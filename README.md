# horiseon-refactor
Challenge 1

For this refactor I adjusted and corrected the order and syntax in the CSS. I also adjusted some of the HTML so that it is not div soup (included a header, section elements, and a footer). I also corrected the missing link in the header, so that should now be working.

I was unable to upload a screenshot to this README.

I was also unable to git push origin main/master at all throughout the process. I tried multiple options and got multiple errors when trying to push my documents. The result was that I dragged the folder into Github once I had already completed the refactoring and then had to manipulate the link by adding /Develop at the end for it even to render the html file I uploaded.
